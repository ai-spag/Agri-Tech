# Agri-Tech Pioneers – Blockchain x Agriculture

Welcome to the official repository of Agri-Tech Pioneers program. We merge agricultural innovation, blockchain infrastructure, and educational empowerment to create sustainable food systems and economic opportunity through technology.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `contracts/` – Rust-based Solana smart contracts for vertical farming, crop tracking, and tokenized sales.
- `curriculums/` – 12-week Blockchain Bootcamp + Agri-Tech vertical farming modules.
- `dao/` – DAO governance rules, voting protocols, and smart contract proposals.
- `docs/` – Grant proposals, whitepapers, technical documentation, and reports.
- `infrastructure/` – Sensor logic, node setup, environmental data feeds, and blockchain explorer ideas.
- `marketing/` – Community decks, onboarding guides, branding materials.

## 🧠 Curriculum Flow (14 Weeks)
- **Weeks 1-12**: 45-minute sessions (15 mins lecture, 30 mins exploration)
- **Weeks 13–14**: Demo days for student-led vertical farm and smart contract showcase

## 🌾 Sales Pipeline
Crops cultivated during the program are sold via a blockchain-enabled local market and token-gated platform.

## 🔗 Tech Stack
- Language: Rust
- Blockchain: Solana
- DAO Infrastructure: Anchor, SPL tokens
- Frontend: SvelteKit (planned)
